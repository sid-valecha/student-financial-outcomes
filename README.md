# Financial Outcomes of College Graduates: A Field of Study Analysis

## Introduction

In recent years, the rising cost of higher education and the burden of student loan debt have become critical issues in the United States. As more students enroll in post-secondary institutions, understanding the factors that influence their financial outcomes is increasingly important.

This project explores the relationship between students’ **fields of study** and their **financial outcomes**, focusing on:

* **Average student loan debt at graduation**
* **Earnings one year after graduation**

### Key Questions:

* How does student debt differ between **STEM** (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) and **non-STEM** graduates?
* Is there a significant difference in their **earnings one year after graduation**?
* How do **financial aid offerings and costs of attendance** compare between **public and private institutions**?
* What is the relationship between the **proportion of students receiving financial aid** and **graduation rates**?

By addressing these questions, this analysis aims to shed light on how financial aspects of college may impact student decision-making and future success.

## Background & Data Source

The dataset used for this project is from the **College Scorecard** ([collegescorecard.ed.gov/data](https://collegescorecard.ed.gov/data/)), a resource provided by the U.S. Department of Education.

### Dataset Details:

* Covers academic years **1996–97 to 2022–23**
* Institution-level and field-of-study-level data
* Includes information on:

  * Credential level
  * Field of study (CIP code)
  * Cumulative student debt at graduation
  * Earnings one year post-graduation
  * Financial aid and cost of attendance
  * Graduation rates

All institutions included participate in federal student financial aid programs, making the dataset both comprehensive and representative.

## Limitations

* **Self-selection bias**: Students may choose majors based on interests or financial expectations, affecting outcomes.
* **Short-term earnings**: Only captures income **one year after graduation**, which may not reflect long-term earning potential.
* **Data suppression**: Some fields have values listed as `"PrivacySuppressed"` due to privacy concerns.
* **Uneven aid/support**: Variability in financial aid or family support is not fully accounted for.

Despite these limitations, the dataset provides strong insights into how college decisions can influence financial well-being.
